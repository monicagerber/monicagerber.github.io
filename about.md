## Hello!  

My name is Monica Gerber. I am a biostatistician and epidemiologist at a hospital in Boston, MA in the department of psychiatry. I'm interested in psychiatric epidemiology and translational epidemiology. I have a MPH (biostatistics & epidemiology concentraions) from [Boston University School of Public Health](https://www.bu.edu/sph/) and a BA in anthropology from [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu).  

I'm passionate about the field of public health. I think communicating findings, both to other researchers and to the public, is key to improving population health.  

When I'm not doing research you can find me riding my bike, cooking Mexican food, making homemade bitters, and reading nerdy books about statistics.  


### Find me other places

Thanks for reading!
