## Hello!  

I'm Monica. I want to make the world a better place by finding solutions for complex public health problems. I have a MPH (biostatistics & epidemiology concentrations) from [Boston University School of Public Health](https://www.bu.edu/sph/) and a BA in anthropology from [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu).  

When I'm not doing research you can find me riding my bike, cooking Mexican food, making homemade bitters, and reading nerdy books about statistics.  

### Find me other places
You can find me on twitter: [@mwgerber](https://twitter.com/mwgerber).
